 * @author bluebackdev
 * Write a program that lets the user play the game of Rock, Paper, Scissors
 * against the computer. The program should work as follows:
 * 
 * 1. When the program begins, a random number in the range of 1 through 3 is
 * generated. If the number is 1, then the computer has chosen rock. If the
 * number is 2, then the computer has chosen paper. If the number is 3, then
 * the computer has chosen scissors. (Don't display the computer's choice yet)
 * 
 * 2. The user enters his or her choice of "rock", "paper", or "scissors" at
 * the keyboard. (You can use a menu if you prefer.)
 * 
 * 3. The computer's choice is displayed.
 * 
 * 4. A winner is selected according to the following rules:
 * 
 *      * If one player chooses rock and the other player chooses scissors,
 *        then rock wins. (The rock smashes scissors.)
 *      * If one player chooses scissors and the other player chooses paper,
 *        then scissors wins. (Scissors cuts paper.)
 *      * If one player chooses paper and the other player chooses rock,
 *        then paper wins. (Paper wraps rock.)
 *      * If both players make the same choice, the game must be played again
 *        to determine the winner.
 * 
 * Be sure to divide the program into methods that perform each major task.
